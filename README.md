# Covid-Tracking-in-Kenya-Apr-2020-Basemap-Visualization
I volunteered to help visualize the level of need and preparedness in relation to Covid-19 for one of my acquaintances. 
Having just learned about Basemap at that time, I thought to try out some Basemap visualizations. The source code can be found in kenya_covid_visualizations.py and the visualizations in the two different folders. In the first folder, I visualized the number of a certain amenity or facility, e.g. Number of Hospitals, 
per county. In the second folder, I played around with visualizing whether the number of amenities present met the required benchmark. Datasets and source code used are both included. 

Below is a sample visualization:
